# Loan Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning-based loan risk prediction system**.  
The main objective is to analyze loan application data and predict whether an applicant is likely to **default** or **repay** the loan.

The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning skills, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Result interpretation

This repository is designed to showcase practical machine learning knowledge for **academic purposes and job applications**.

##  Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant risk when approving loans.  
Incorrectly approving high-risk applicants can result in financial losses, while rejecting low-risk applicants can reduce revenue.

This project aims to:
- Assist lenders in assessing loan risk
- Improve decision-making accuracy
- Reduce default rates using predictive modeling

---

##  Dataset Description
- **Dataset Type:** Loan application data
- **Records Include:**
  - Applicant income
  - Loan amount
  - Credit history
  - Employment information
  - Loan status (target variable)

- **Target Variable:**  
  Loan Risk / Loan Status (e.g., Default vs Non-Default)

The dataset is used to train and evaluate classification models.

##  Technologies & Libraries
The project is implemented using the following tools:
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

##  Machine Learning Workflow
The project follows a structured ML pipeline:

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Dataset inspection
- Checking data types
- Identifying missing values
- Understanding feature distributions

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Removing inconsistencies

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Selecting relevant features
- Preparing data for model training
- Improving model performance through clean inputs

### 4️⃣ Model Training
Classification models used include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier  
(Models can be extended further)

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
